Our Mission
The organizationâ€™s mission is to foster meaningful connections between local youth and elders, including seniors from diverse cultural backgrounds who have recently arrived in Canada. Through this initiative, our goal is to cultivate compassionate and inclusive communities. We are dedicated to connecting youth supporting the integration of these seniors into Canadian society by providing a wide range of supportive programs, including organizing and coordinating volunteer activities, events, and initiatives tailored to their specific needs. Collaborating with various organizations, our initiatives encompass offering companionship, organizing workshops, clubs, and engaging in activities such as literacy programs, computer application training, handcrafts, sewing, dancing, singing, and culturally relevant field trips. We believe in the importance of providing convenience and support for the elderly, enhancing their sense of belonging and happiness. Elderly individuals who are not lonely and experience a sense of happiness are often those who maintain good health.
Furthermore, our organization will emphasize the creation of opportunities for seniors to engage socially with both younger generations and their peers. This focus on social interaction aims to instill a sense of purpose, meaning, and belonging within the community. Our approach involves facilitating opportunities for seniors to share valuable life experiences, skills and languages with the youth, thus contributing to the community's well-being and growth.
